**Can I definitely take part?**

Not everyone will be able to take part in this study. Only individuals that meet the study entry requirements and are willing to participate may take part.

If you decide you would like to take part, you can get in contact with us and we will go through a telephone screening. At this screening, you will have the opportunity to ask any questions you may have regarding the study. You will be asked to sign a consent form, either electronically or handwritten, should you wish to continue.

**What if the tests show I can take part?**

If you meet all the entry requirements for the AND-PD study, you may be enrolled onto the study on the same day. If you need time to discuss your participation in the study with family, friends or GP then a member of the research team will contact you at a later date to answer any questions you may have and to arrange a convenient time for you to return to the hospital/clinic to be enrolled onto the study. The research staff will go through the next key steps with you.

**What will happen to me during the study?**

You will be asked to attend three (3) study appointments over a 12-month period: the screening visit (visit 1), baseline (visit 2) and follow-up at 6 months (visit 3) and follow-up at 12 months (visit4/final visit). Currently, we are doing all assessments online and there is no need to come into the centre unless you decide to have an MRI scan. 

The assessments include a physical examination, psychology testing and computer-based tasks. Participants can also have (optional) brain scans (MRI) to measure brain responses correlating with measures of anxiety in different regions of the brain. The assessments for the current study will include medical history, physical tests, neuropsychological assessment, clinical questionnaires, behavioural testing, and a structural and functional MRI scan. We will give you the option to be video recorded in order to help us standardised the marking and analysis of these tests.

The computer-based tasks will be piloted (tested) at the beginning of the study and refined as the study progresses. Pilot studies are small-scale, preliminary studies which aim to investigate whether all components of a study will be feasible. They may be used to improve upon various aspects of the study design. We will be looking at the ease of administering the different tasks, and any feedback participants might have about them across both sites (UCL and KCL).The tests will include tasks such as naming colours, calculation or selecting cards to gain reward points.

At each study visit, you will be asked to complete several study assessments including questionnaires. These questionnaires will contain questions asking about your anxiety symptoms, depression, and your movement symptoms. There will also be general questions asking about your quality of life. Your doctor will complete some scales also asking about your movement skills and your mental capabilities. The various assessments and questionnaires performed at each study visit are shown in the Summary of Assessments at the end of this patient information sheet.

The study visits will either be online or at the clinical centre where you were recruit to the study.
The MRI scans will be carried out either at Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, Queen Square (or if you are being seen at KCH, then your scan will be at the Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences). The scans will be carried out by a radiographer and one of the researchers. Heart rate and skin-conductance measurements will be carried out during your MRI appointment.

You will be assessed at baseline and then invited back for reassessment after 6 months (visit 3) and one further follow-up visit at 12 months.

**What checks and tests will be done?**

We estimate the screening/baseline visit assessments and questionnaires will take between one and a half to two hours. The MRI scan, will take around two to three hours if you decide to have one. We anticipate that the assessments and questionnaires at follow up visits will be completed in under three hours. Each testing session can be done over two days, if preferred.

Many of the assessments and tests can be carried out securely online. Some of the questionnaires can be emailed or posted prior to the study days, answered at home and either completed online, emailed, or brought to the assessment on the day.
