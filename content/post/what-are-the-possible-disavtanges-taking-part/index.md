The risks of taking part in the observational study are very low as this does not involve a drug or device other than your own computer. The main potential risk is discomfort or increased anxiety at the time of the assessments. We will take careful measures during the assessments, considering physical and emotional issues, and will break up assessments as desired by you.
In case you have any worries about having the study procedures, please contact us (and-pd@ucl.ac.uk) for advice and we will discuss this with you.

If you would like some support with your anxiety, Anxiety UK is a charity providing support for people with an anxiety condition. Phone: 03444 775 774 (Monday to Friday, 9.30am to 5.30pm). Website: www.anxietyuk.org.uk. You can also speak to your doctor for advice.

**What happens if something suspicious is seen on my MRI?**

The brain scans we do are not designed to diagnose disease; however, abnormalities are occasionally detected during the scanning process. Most of these are no cause for concern. In some cases, identification of a major abnormality that requires action will be reported to the doctor you specify on your MRI consent form and to the study investigators.

It is important to understand that we will not notice all potentially serious abnormalities. If you do not receive any feedback from us, you should not regard this as reassurance about your health, and it should not stop you from seeing your doctor about health concerns you might have.

If you suffer from claustrophobia, you should notify a member of the study team before you have the MRI scan in case you become anxious while in the magnetic resonance scanner. There will be loud noises such as knocking or hammering that occur while the MRI is being conducted. You should also inform the study doctor if you have a pacemaker or metal implants (screws, plates, or clips) because this may preclude MR evaluation; a radiographer will undertake a final check that there is nothing that makes is unsafe for you to be scanned on the day of your scan, but please discuss any potential issues with the study team before your visit if at all possible.

Please let the study team know as soon as possible if you are suffering from COVID symptoms or may have come into contact with someone with COVID, and if so, please DO NOT come to the scanning centre.
